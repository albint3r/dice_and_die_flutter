### Welcome to Dice n Die Multiplayer

#### Overview

Dice n Die Multiplayer is an exhilarating multiplayer game based on the mini-game Dice n Die from Cult of Lamb. The objective is to accumulate the highest number of points before one of the two players completes their board. The game proceeds in turns, where each player rolls a die and places the result in a column of their choice. Points are multiplied by the number of repetitions in the same column. Additionally, players can remove numbers from the opponent's board if the resulting number matches one already present on that board.

#### Motivation

Dice n Die Multiplayer arose from the need to meet the demand of those who enjoyed the original mini-game. Although fun, it lacked a multiplayer experience. 

I started my initial version, developed in Python from the terminal, allowed playing with friends but lacked a satisfying experience due to its limited interface.

Transitioning to a graphical interface with Pygame improved the experience, but it was still restricted to a single device, which was inconvenient. I decided to bring the game to mobile devices to make it more accessible and suitable for quick and enjoyable matches anytime, anywhere.

The current motivation is to transform the game into a full-fledged multiplayer application. This involved implementing a server to manage aspects such as dice rolls, column selection, score calculation, opponent number removal, and turn organization. For this, Fast API in Python was used to create a secure and efficient REST API.
